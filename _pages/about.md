I am a Ph.D. student in Economics at The George Washington University, specializing in Time Series Forecasting, Monetary Policy, and the application of Machine Learning in Macroeconomics and Energy Economics.  

My research on monetary policy focuses on understanding its transmission mechanisms and macroeconomic effects through both empirical and structural approaches. I have utilized VAR-type models to capture short-term dynamic interactions among key economic variables, and developed extended DSGE frameworks. Building on these theoretical and empirical foundations, I employ advanced deep learning architectures to forecast complex financial and economic time series.  

My long-term goal is to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and economics, integrating interpretable AI methodologies with rigorous economic modeling. By doing so, I aim to generate policy-relevant insights that enhance the robustness and accuracy of economic forecasts, ultimately contributing to more data-driven and resilient decision-making in an increasingly complex global environment.
