I am a Ph.D. student in Economics at The George Washington University, specializing in time series forecasting, monetary policy uncertainty, and the application of machine learning in macroeconomics and energy economics.  

My research integrates interpretable deep learning techniques with rigorous economic theory to improve forecasting accuracy for complex economic and financial time series such as inflation and international oil prices. I am particularly interested in leveraging frequency-domain decomposition and attention-based architectures to capture structural breaks, volatility shifts, and multi-scale dynamics in economic data.  

Beyond academia, I aim to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI methodologies and policy-relevant economic analysis, providing insights that support more resilient and data-driven decision-making in a rapidly evolving global economy.
